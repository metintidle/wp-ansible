 âœ… Complete Automated IP Range Solution

  How It Works:

  1. Build-Time Updates: update-bot-ips.js fetches latest IPs before
  deployment
  2. Fallback Safety: Code works even if update fails
  3. Automated Workflow: GitHub Actions runs weekly updates
  4. Safe Deployment: Creates PRs for review before changes

  Usage:

  # Manual update
  npm run update-ips

  # Build and deploy  
  npm run build
  npm run deploy

  # Test the function
  node -e "console.log(require('./bot-ip-ranges.js'))"

  Automatic Updates:

  - Weekly: GitHub Actions fetches new Google IPs
  - Pull Requests: Creates PRs with changes for review
  - Safe: Never auto-deploys, always requires human approval

  API Sources Used:

  - Google: https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/goog.json (official)
  - Microsoft: Manual ranges (they don't have public API)
  - Others: Could be extended with more sources

  Benefits:

  1. Always Fresh: Weekly automated updates
  2. Zero Downtime: Fallback ranges if updates fail
  3. Safe: Review process via PRs
  4. Extensible: Easy to add more bot IP sources

  Alternative Solutions:

  - CloudFormation Parameters: Store IPs as stack parameters
  - S3 Config: Store ranges in S3, fetch during deployment
  - External Service: Build microservice that provides current ranges
