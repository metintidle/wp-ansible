# About

I want to create a script to create a scheduler for taking database backup every 12:00 or midnight As every database in the each file. The best thing is to use a cron job in Linux for running the Mesh script. 

Database connection string:
user: itt-admin
password: GCdGb!fNmk!!3dH
Host: 152.69.175.15

I think it's a good idea to add That connection string as enviroment variable in the zshs profile.
